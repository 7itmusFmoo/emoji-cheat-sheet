If you are looking for a software that can remove all kinds of trojans, malware, spyware, and other threats from your computer, you might have come across a program called FULLTROJANREMOVER670Patched. This program claims to be able to scan your system and detect any hidden infections, and then remove them with a few clicks. But is it really as effective and reliable as it sounds?

The answer is no. FULLTROJANREMOVER670Patched is actually a fake antivirus program that belongs to the Rogue.FakeRean-Braviax family of malware. This family of malware is known for using different names and interfaces to trick users into thinking that they are legitimate security tools. However, they are nothing but scams that try to scare users into buying their full versions by showing fake scan results and pop-up warnings.
 
FULLTROJANREMOVER670Patched works by modifying your registry settings and creating malicious files on your system. It then launches itself every time you start your computer and performs a fake scan that shows dozens of infections that do not exist. It also blocks your access to other programs and websites, and displays constant alerts that urge you to activate the full version of the program to remove the threats. If you click on any of these alerts, you will be redirected to a payment page where you will be asked to enter your credit card details and personal information.
 
Do not fall for this scam. FULLTROJANREMOVER670Patched is not a real antivirus program and cannot protect your computer from any threats. In fact, it is a threat itself that can compromise your security and privacy. If you have installed this program on your computer, you should remove it as soon as possible using a reputable anti-malware tool. Do not pay any money or provide any information to the cybercriminals behind this scam.
