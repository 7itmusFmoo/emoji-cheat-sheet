## What's new in Adobe Flash CC 2015?
 
The 2015 release of Flash Professional CC provides you the following features and enhancements [^3^]:
 
- New bone tool for inverse kinematics (IK) animation
- Ability to import H.264 videos with audio
- Export bitmaps as sprite sheet for HTML5 Canvas

## How to use the new bone tool in Adobe Flash CC 2015
 
The bone tool is a feature that allows you to create inverse kinematics (IK) animations in Adobe Flash CC 2015. IK animations are based on bones that are linked together in a chain or a hierarchy. When you move one bone, the connected bones move accordingly. This makes it easier to create natural and realistic movements for your characters or objects.
 
To use the bone tool, you need to have symbol instances or shapes on the Stage. You can add bones to movie clip, graphic, button, or text symbols. You can also draw shapes in Object Drawing mode and add bones to them. Each symbol instance or shape can have only one bone.
 
Here are the steps to use the bone tool:

1. Select the Bone tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the symbol instance or shape that you want to set as the root bone of the armature. The armature is the collection of bones that form an IK animation.
3. Click at the point where you want to attach the bone to the symbol or shape. By default, Flash creates the bone at the location of mouse click. For a more precise way of adding a bone, turn off Auto Set Transformation Point for IK Bone Tool ( Edit > Preferences > Drawing ). With Auto Set Transformation Point turned off, the bone will snap to the symbol or shape transformation point when you click from one symbol or shape to the next.
4. Drag to another symbol instance or shape and release the mouse button. Flash creates another bone and links it to the previous one.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you finish creating your armature. You can create linear or branched armatures depending on your animation needs.
6. To test your animation, select the Selection tool and drag any of the bones on the Stage. You will see how the connected bones move in relation to each other.
7. To animate your armature, use keyframes on the Timeline. You can specify the start and end positions of bones on different frames and Flash will automatically interpolate the positions of the bones in between.
