# How to Install BDE for RAD Studio, Delphi, C++Builder 10.2 Tokyo
 
BDE (Borland Database Engine) is a deprecated database access library that was used by Delphi and C++Builder for many years. It is no longer included in the latest versions of RAD Studio, and developers are encouraged to migrate to newer technologies like FireDAC. However, if you still need to use BDE for legacy applications, you can download and install it separately.

In this article, we will show you how to install BDE for RAD Studio, Delphi, C++Builder 10.2 Tokyo, and how to use it with the standard data components.
 
## Step 1: Download the BDE Installer
 
The BDE installer is not available from the RAD Studio installer, but you can download it from your "My registered user downloads" section on the Embarcadero website[^3^]. You need to have a valid license for RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo to access this section.
 
Alternatively, you can use this direct link: http://cc.embarcadero.com/item/30752[^3^]. Note that you need to log in with your Embarcadero account to download the file.
 
## Step 2: Run the BDE Installer
 
After downloading the BDE installer file (BDEInstaller\_10\_2\_Tokyo.exe), run it as administrator and follow the instructions. The installer will copy the necessary files to your RAD Studio installation folder (by default, C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\19.0).

You can choose to install the full BDE package or a subset of it, depending on your needs. The installer will also create a registry entry for the BDE configuration.
 
## Step 3: Install the BDE Components
 
If you want to use the BDE components at design time, you need to install them into the RAD Studio IDE. To do this, open RAD Studio and go to Component > Install Packages. Click on Add and browse to the BPL file that corresponds to your platform and language. For example, for Delphi 32-bit, use dclbde270.bpl[^2^]. For C++Builder 64-bit, use dclcbde270.bpl.
 
After adding the BPL file, you should see a confirmation message that says "Package C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\19.0\bin\dclbde270.bpl has been installed." Click on OK and close the dialog.
 
## Step 4: Use the BDE Components
 
Now you can use the BDE components in your projects. You can find them under the BDE category in the Tool Palette. The most commonly used components are TDatabase, TTable, TQuery, and TStoredProc.
 
To use these components, you need to configure a database alias using the BDE Administrator tool. You can launch it from Start > Programs > Embarcadero RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo > Database Tools > BDE Administrator. Alternatively, you can run bdeadmin.exe from C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Borland Shared\BDE.
 
In the BDE Administrator, you can create and edit database aliases, which are logical names for database connections. You can specify various parameters for each alias, such as driver type, server name, user name, password, etc. For more information on how to use the BDE Administrator, see https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Using\_the\_BDE\_Administrator[^4^].
 
After creating an alias, you can use it with the TDatabase component by setting its DatabaseName property. Then you can use other BDE components by linking them to the TDatabase component via their DatabaseName property. For example, you can use a TTable component to access a table in your database by setting its TableName property.
